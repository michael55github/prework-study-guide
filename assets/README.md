# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide Webpage is a personal resource for me to advance my abilities as a developer.  It will assist with tracking knowledge to be learned and studied.

- What was your motivation?
I want to be an awesome developer and make the most of UCLA's immersive coding course.
- Why did you build this project?
To go over the fundamentals to make sure I can hit the ground running come Monday!
- What problem does it solve?
This project has helped me get accustomed to software development best practices and processes to prepare me for a career working in teams at larger firms.
- What did you learn?
An introduction to the full spectrum process of developing software.  Starting with downloading and configuring the tools we'll be using to live deployment.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

I should use this as a study guide when in doubt over where to direct my efforts.  Each section also contains notes about the relevant sectio topic.

If you open the DevTools console, you can see the JavaScript running.  It will list topics we learned from prework and choose a topic at random for me to study.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
